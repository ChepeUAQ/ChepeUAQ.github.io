                <h2>Early life and Pre-Nintendo career</h2>
                <p>Satoru Iwata was born in 1959 in Hokkaido, Japan. At a young age he demonstrated a great leadership manner at school
                and remarkable computer skills.</p>
                <p>When he worked at HAL Laboratory in 1980 as a programmer, he elaborated his very first creations such as a device capable of displaying
                graphics on older computers. A few years later, in 1983, Iwata became the company's coordinator of software production,
                during that time Iwata helped HAL to establish a relationship with Nintendo.</p>
                <p>He eventually was promoted to president of HAL in 1993.</p>

                <br>
                
                <h2>Nintendo career</h2>
                <p>For this next segment we'll be listing Iwata's achievemts at Nintendo by year:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>2000-2002</b>: Iwata joins Nintendo as the head of its corporate planning division in 2000. During this time he focuses on
                        reducing the cost of game development as a whole while mantaining quality. <br>
                        He became president of Nintendo on May 24th 2002.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <b>2003-2009</b>: During a decling era in videogames as a whole, Iwata was sure that the problem was caused by focusing 
                        on "Core Gamers" and not on the general public, he thought that the market of videogames should expand beyond just that. <br>
                        As such, he assisted and oversaw the development of Nintendo's most successful consoles, the Nintendo DS and the Wii.
                        Both systems and their respective games were designed to appeal to the general public, and it worked, Nintendo's sales
                        skyrocketed and both consoles became the best performing ones in the history of the company.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <b>2010-2014</b>: At this period, Nintendo's most recent consoles, the WiiU and Nintendo 3DS, were performing poorly
                        and subsequently the company as a whole was too. It got so bad that Iwata has to cut his own salary so it wouldn't be
                        necessary to cut the employees salary. 
                        In June 2013, Iwata assumed the role of Nintendo of America CEO and introduced the concept of Amiibos. Amiibos were a 
                        huge success and they helped the company during difficult times.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <b>2015</b>: On July 11th, 2015 Satoru Iwata died at the age of 55 due to health complications from a tumor. With that event,
                        the gaming industry lost one of its key leaders and one of the world's most brilliant mind and heart alike. His legacy will
                        forever be remembered and we still see glimpses of his ideas to this day.
