                <header>Items</header>
                <p>There are over a thousand items and trinkets in the latest version of the game, we won't be going over every single one of course but here'es a general explanation of how the item system works:</p>
                <p><b>Passive items</b> are the most common kind in the game, their function is simple: You grab the item and then that item's effect modifies your attack pattern, stats, abilities, size or it applies you a special effect permanently.</p>
                <p><b>Active items</b> function on a different way: You grab the item, it only activates when you press the <i>spacebar</i> key, it may only be used when its charged and its effects usually only last for a single room.</p>
                <p><b>Trinkets</b> are maybe the most easily explained: You grab the trinket and aquire its effect permanently until you decide to drop by holding the <i>Ctrl</i> key.</p>
